Doping introduces additional charge carriers:\n- n-type: adds free electrons in the conduction band\n- p-type: creates holes in the valence band\n\nEven a tiny amount of dopant (1 in $10^6$ atoms) can increase conductivity by **several orders of magnitude** (e.g., from $10^{-4}$ to $10^2$ S/m).\n\n**(c) Role of Silicon and Germanium as Memory Materials:**\n\n**Silicon (Si):**\n- Most widely used semiconductor in the electronics industry\n- Band gap of **1.12 eV** — optimal for room-temperature operation\n- Basis of **MOSFET transistors** used in all modern memory devices (SRAM, DRAM, Flash)\n- Silicon dioxide ($\\text{SiO}_2$) forms a natural, high-quality **insulating layer** — crucial for gate oxide in transistors\n- Abundant (second most common element in Earth's crust), cheap to process\n- Used in **flash memory** (NAND/NOR), **DRAM**, and **SRAM** chips\n\n**Germanium (Ge):**\n- Band gap of **0.67 eV** — historically the first semiconductor used in transistors\n- Higher **electron and hole mobility** than silicon → faster switching speeds\n- Used in **high-speed memory** and **SiGe alloy** (Silicon-Germanium) devices\n- SiGe technology combines Si's manufacturing advantages with Ge's speed → used in high-performance cache memory\n- Applications in **radiation-hardened memory** for aerospace and military\n\n**(d) Useful Properties of Semiconductors:**\n\n1. **Tunable conductivity:** Conductivity can be precisely controlled by doping concentration — enables design of custom electronic components\n2. **Temperature sensitivity:** Conductivity increases with temperature (unlike metals) — useful in temperature sensors and thermistors\n3. **Band gap:** The energy gap between valence and conduction bands determines optical and electrical properties — enables LEDs, solar cells, and photodetectors\n4. **p-n junction formation:** When p-type and n-type semiconductors are joined, they form a p-n junction — the basis of diodes, transistors, solar cells, and integrated circuits\n5. **Photoconductivity:** Semiconductors can generate electron-hole pairs when exposed to light — basis of solar cells and photodetectors",
