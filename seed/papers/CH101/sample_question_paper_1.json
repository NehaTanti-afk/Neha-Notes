      "solution": "**(a) Electrochemical Theory of Corrosion — Rusting of Iron:**\n\nCorrosion of iron (rusting) is an **electrochemical process** that occurs in the presence of moisture and oxygen. The metal surface acts as a short-circuited electrochemical cell with **anodic** and **cathodic** regions.\n\n**At the anodic region** (where corrosion occurs):\n\n$$\\text{Fe}(s) \\rightarrow \\text{Fe}^{2+}(aq) + 2e^- \\quad (E^\\circ = -0.44 \\text{ V})$$\n\nIron is oxidized and dissolves.\n\n**At the cathodic region** (in neutral/slightly acidic aerobic conditions):\n\n$$\\text{O}_2 + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} + 4e^- \\rightarrow 4\\text{OH}^- \\quad (E^\\circ = +0.40 \\text{ V})$$\n\n**Overall reaction:**\n\n$$2\\text{Fe} + \\text{O}_2 + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow 2\\text{Fe(OH)}_2$$\n\nFerrous hydroxide is further oxidized by atmospheric oxygen:\n\n$$4\\text{Fe(OH)}_2 + \\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2[\\text{Fe}_2\\text{O}_3 \\cdot 3\\text{H}_2\\text{O}]$$\n\nThis hydrated ferric oxide ($\\text{Fe}_2\\text{O}_3 \\cdot x\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$) is the **rust** — a reddish-brown, porous, and non-protective layer that flakes off, exposing fresh metal to further corrosion.\n\n**(b) Factors Affecting the Rate of Corrosion:**\n\n**Nature of Metal:**\n\n1. **Physical state:** Metals under stress, strained, or at grain boundaries corrode faster than annealed (stress-free) metals\n2. **Purity:** Impure metals corrode faster because impurities create local galvanic cells. Pure metals are more resistant\n3. **Position in galvanic series:** The farther apart two metals are in the galvanic series, the faster the more active (anodic) metal corrodes. Metals higher in the series (more active) corrode preferentially\n4. **Relative areas of anode and cathode:** A small anodic area with a large cathodic area leads to **intense, localized corrosion** (pitting). A large anode with small cathode gives slower, uniform corrosion\n\n**Nature of Environment:**\n\n1. **Moisture/humidity:** Higher humidity increases corrosion rate — water acts as the electrolyte\n2. **Temperature:** Higher temperature generally accelerates corrosion (increased reaction rates)\n3. **Presence of dissolved gases:** $\\text{O}_2$, $\\text{CO}_2$, $\\text{SO}_2$ in water increase corrosion. Dissolved oxygen is the primary cathodic depolarizer\n4. **pH:** Acidic environments accelerate corrosion; alkaline conditions can be protective for some metals\n5. **Presence of salts/electrolytes:** Dissolved salts increase conductivity of the electrolyte, accelerating corrosion (e.g., seawater corrodes faster than freshwater)\n\n**(c) Corrosion Control Methods:**\n\n**Cathodic Protection:**\n\nMaking the metal to be protected the **cathode** of an electrochemical cell.\n\n*Method 1: Sacrificial Anode Method*\n- A more **electropositive (active)** metal (e.g., Zn, Mg, Al) is connected to the structure\n- The sacrificial anode corrodes preferentially while the protected metal remains intact\n- Example: Zinc blocks attached to ship hulls, underground pipelines\n\n*Method 2: Impressed Current Method*\n- An external DC power source forces the protected metal to become the cathode\n- An inert anode (graphite, platinum) is used\n- Used for large structures like bridges, storage tanks, pipelines\n\n**Anodic Protection:**\n\nApplying a **controlled external potential** to the metal to form a thin, stable, passive **oxide layer** on its surface. This oxide film acts as a barrier and prevents further corrosion.\n\n- The metal is made the **anode** in an electrochemical cell\n- A small controlled current maintains the passive film\n- Effective for metals that form stable oxide layers (e.g., stainless steel, titanium)\n- Used for protecting storage tanks containing corrosive chemicals (sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid)\n\n**Inorganic Coatings:**\n\n1. **Galvanization:** Coating iron/steel with a layer of **zinc** by hot-dipping. Even if scratched, zinc corrodes preferentially (sacrificial protection)\n2. **Tinning:** Coating with **tin** — provides barrier protection. If scratched, iron corrodes faster (tin is cathodic to iron)\n3. **Phosphating:** Treating metal surface with phosphoric acid solution to form an insoluble iron/zinc phosphate layer — used as a base for paint\n4. **Chromate coating:** Immersion in chromate solution forms a thin protective chromium oxide film",
